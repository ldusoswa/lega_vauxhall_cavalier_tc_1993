COAST_CURVE=FROM_COAST_REF 		; coast curve. can define 3 different options (coast reference, coast values for mathematical curve, coast curve file)


[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1			; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.115					; engine inertia
LIMITER=7200					; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter
LIMITER_HZ=25					; Frequency of engine limiter
MINIMUM=1200					; Idle rpm
DEFAULT_TURBO_ADJUSTMENT=0.0			; DEFAULT turbo adjustment if one or more turbos are cockpit adjustable

[COAST_REF]
RPM=8000						; rev number reference
TORQUE=110						; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference
NON_LINEARITY=0					; coast engine brake from ZERO to TORQUE value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[COAST_DATA]					; OBSOLETE SECTION. Must copy to keep AC from crashing, but do not use for data
COAST0=0						; OBSOLETE SECTION. Must copy to keep AC from crashing, but do not use for data
COAST1=0						; OBSOLETE SECTION. Must copy to keep AC from crashing, but do not use for data

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.992					; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.995					; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=2.74					; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=1.9				; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=1.9			; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=3000				; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=2.98						; Turbo pressure sensitivity on accelerator pedal
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0				; cockpit adjustable turbo pressure

[DAMAGE]
TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD=2.50  ; level of TOTAL boost before the engine starts to take damage
TURBO_DAMAGE_K=15			; amount of damage per second per (boost - threshold)
RPM_THRESHOLD=7550			; RPM at which the engine starts to take damage
RPM_DAMAGE_K=1			; amount of damage per second per (rpm-threshold)
